According to the 1991 census, the state has a population of 3,836,333 after the creation of Gombe State in 1996. Bauchi State is one of the states in Northern part of Nigeria that spans two distinctive vegetation zones, namely the Sudan savannah and the Sahel Savannah.

            The Sudan savannah type of vegetation covers the southern part of the state. Here, the vegetation gets richer and richer towards the South, especially along water sources or rivers but generally, the vegetation is less uniform and grasses are shorter than what obtains further South, that is in the forest zone of the middle belt. The Sahel type of Savannah which is also known as the semi-desert vegetation becomes manifest from the middle of the state as one moves from the South to the Northern part of the State.
            
            The characteristics of this type of vegetation comprise of isolated stands of thorny shrubs. On the other hand, the southern part of the state is mountainous as a result of the continuation of the Jos – Plateau, while the northern part is generally sandy.</p>

        <p class="masap">Masa or Waina is a rice cake that is from the northern part of Nigeria and is traditionally eaten by the Hausa tribe. Nigeria is a country with different cultures, traditions, people and with that comes assorted food, cooking method, and recipe. The Northerners are known for their healthy and sumptuous meals and Masa is one of such meals. Masa bauchi is the popular identity for every masa in the north; irrespective of the state or town. It is used occasionally in ceremonial and festive periods and when combined with suya as snacks/appetizers, the result is simply AH-mazing!</p> 
    </div>
    <div> 
        <p class="masap"> Masa is a fermented puff batter of short-grain species of rice called tuwo rice/millet/ maize or sorghum that is cooked in a pan which usually makes it have the oval shape. The good thing about tuwo rice is that it tend to stick together with one another and retain moisture, unlike the conventional rice grains that tends to stay apart. It reminds me so much of the Japanese sushi and rice cakes that are incredibly sticky and rice is the main ingredient. And also Sinasir, a delicacy in Borno, Northern part of Nigeria which is a  white rice recipe fried like pancakes. Just like masa, it is made with the soft variety of rice, the type used for Tuwo Shinkafa.</p>
